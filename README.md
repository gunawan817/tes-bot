<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

This Repository was created by the NFT-Bot-Team and hosts some sample code on how to retrieve Sales and Listings Events from Opensea.
The idea was to create a easy to read and understand code, which can be used to build your own Project around NFT Sales and Listings events.

Please let us know if you need support with the code on our homepage or Discord Channel.

If you feel like not investing to much into self coding your NFT Sales and Listings bot for all the marketplaces out there feel free to get in
touch with us.

We've already built a bot Monitoring all Sales and Listings Events for most NFT Marketplaces out there:
* Opensea
* Solanart
* Magiceden
* Alpha.art

Further we are also able to send those Events to Discord and your desired Twitter Account to increase your Awareness on social media. Just join our Discord Server and let us know about your question and how we can help you to scale your NFT Collection to the next level.
